# Java_Game

### Overview

An exploration of Java programming and Java syntax

Created a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game to demonstrate and explore simple game programming in a Java environment

Mostly for my own beinifit to familiarize myself with java, though others are free to reference the material for their own learning

### Development Environment

Developed in VScode, minimal effort to integrate java into the IDE.

Additioal libraries included:
 - java.util.Scanner

### Useful Websites

### Future Work

- Improved UI - current ui is poor and could be vastly improved
- More consise code - current code is potentialy to wordy and clunky could be streamlined
- Consider using an array rather thatn a basic list - list causes problems while coding and makes it harder to program effectively without constantly referencing the printBoard method
- potentially expand game to 3d Tic-Tac-Toe (likely requires complete overhaul)
